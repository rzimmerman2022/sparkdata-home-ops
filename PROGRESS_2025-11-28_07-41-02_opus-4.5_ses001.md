## 2. Objectives & Outcomes

### Original Objectives
1. Analyze two cleaning checklists
2. Add DATE after "Deep_Clean" in document filenames
3. Create/update master to-do list
4. Prepare comprehensive handoff for next AI session

### Actual Outcomes
| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Analyze checklists | Completed | Documented task counts, zones, and assignments for both Person 1 and Person 2 checklists |
| Rename files with date placement | Completed | Moved date from end to after "Deep_Clean_" prefix |
| Create master to-do list | Completed | Created `Master_To_Do_List.md` with completed/pending/in-progress sections |
| Prepare AI handoff | In Progress | Creating handoff documentation system |

### Deviations from Plan
- Discovered additional files in project not initially visible (DEV file, index.html, Full House checklist)
- Created full handoff infrastructure (directories, templates) beyond simple rename task

---

## 3. Technical Decisions Made

### Decision 1: File Naming Convention Update
- **Choice:** Place date immediately after cleaning type prefix
- **Rationale:** User requested format `Deep_Clean_YYYY-MM-DD_...` instead of date at end
- **Trade-offs:** Deviates from documented convention in naming guide (may need guide update)
- **Alternatives rejected:** Keeping date at end per original guide

### Decision 2: Handoff Infrastructure
- **Choice:** Full directory structure with docs/, state/, outputs/
- **Rationale:** Follows user's specified four pillars (Reproducibility, Observability, Idempotency, Progressive Context)
- **Trade-offs:** Adds complexity to simple project
- **Alternatives rejected:** Minimal single-file handoff

## 4. Code Changes

### Files Modified
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Deep_Clean_2025-10-06_Master_Bedroom_and_Kitchen_Person_1_One_Time.html` | Renamed from original (date moved) |
| `Deep_Clean_2025-10-06_Office_and_Living_Areas_Person_2_One_Time.html` | Renamed from original (date moved) |

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Master_To_Do_List.md` | Central task tracking document |
| `docs/handoffs/` | Directory for handoff documents |
| `docs/context/` | Directory for knowledge base |
| `docs/decisions/` | Directory for ADRs |
| `state/` | Directory for session state JSON |
| `outputs/` | Directory for run outputs |
| `PROGRESS_2025-11-28_07-41-02_opus-4.5_ses001.md` | This file |

### New Dependencies Added
- None

### Breaking Changes
- File rename may break any external links to original filenames

---

## 5. Testing & Validation

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| File rename verification | Passed - `ls` confirms new filenames exist |
| Directory creation | Passed - all handoff directories created |
| Git status check | Passed - changes tracked correctly |

### Coverage Metrics
- N/A (HTML/Markdown project, no code tests)

### Performance Impact
- N/A

---

## 6. Knowledge Gained

### Insights About the Codebase
1. Project contains interactive HTML checklists with localStorage persistence
2. Two-person team split for deep cleaning (Person 1: Bedroom/Kitchen, Person 2: Office/Living)
3. Checklists use progress bars and checkbox state saving
4. Naming convention guide exists but may need updating

### Gotchas Discovered
1. Windows bash environment uses `mv` not `ren` for renaming
2. Glob tool may not show all files initially (DEV file was missed)
3. Project has a `.credentials/` folder (likely Google Sheets integration per git history)

### Patterns Identified
1. File naming: `[Type]_[Date]_[Location]_[Role]_[Frequency].html`
2. Checklists follow Phase 1 (Declutter) -> Phase 2 (Deep Clean) structure
3. Each checklist has distinct color scheme (purple for P1, pink/cyan for P2)

---

## 7. Obstacles & Blockers

### Unresolved Issues
| Issue | Impact | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Naming convention guide outdated | Low | Guide shows date at end, files now have date after type |
| DEV file purpose unclear | Low | `Deep_Clean_2025-11-26_Full_House_Single_Cleaner_Prioritized_DEV.html` exists |

### External Dependencies
- None identified

### Knowledge Gaps
- Purpose of `.credentials/` folder and Google Sheets integration
- Whether index.html serves as landing page for checklists

---

## 8. Context Preservation

### State File
- See: `state/session_2025-11-28_07-41-02_opus-4.5_ses001.json`

### Knowledge Base Updates
- To be created: `docs/context/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`

### Links to Past Sessions
- This is the first documented session (ses001)

---

## 9. Next Session Setup

### Immediate Next Steps
```bash
# 1. Review and update naming convention guide
cat "Cleaning_Checklists_File_Naming_Convention_and_Standards_Guide_2025-11-26.md"

# 2. Investigate DEV file purpose
diff Deep_Clean_2025-11-26_Full_House_Single_Cleaner_Prioritized.html Deep_Clean_2025-11-26_Full_House_Single_Cleaner_Prioritized_DEV.html

# 3. Check Google Sheets integration
cat .credentials/ && git log --oneline | grep -i sheet
```

### Prerequisites for Continuation
- Access to project directory: `c:\Projects\Cleaning Checklists`
- Git configured with push access

### Time Estimates
| Task | Estimated Hours |
|------|-----------------|
| Update naming convention guide | 0.25 |
| Investigate DEV file | 0.10 |
| Create additional checklists | 1.00 |
| Add PDF export capability | 2.00 |

---

## Summary

This session established the handoff infrastructure for the Cleaning Checklists project. Two checklist files were renamed to place dates after the cleaning type prefix, a master to-do list was created, and the complete handoff documentation system was implemented following the four pillars of Reproducibility, Observability, Idempotency, and Progressive Context.

**Key deliverable:** Project now has standardized handoff capability for AI-to-AI or AI-to-human transitions.
