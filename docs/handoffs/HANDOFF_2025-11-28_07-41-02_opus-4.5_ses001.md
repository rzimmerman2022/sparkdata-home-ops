**Session:** `ses001`
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-28T07:41:02Z
**Duration:** ~15 minutes

## Executive Summary

This session established foundational handoff infrastructure for the **Cleaning Checklists** project. The project contains interactive HTML checklists for household deep cleaning, split between two team members with distinct zones.

### What Was Accomplished
1. Analyzed two deep cleaning checklists (Person 1: Kitchen/Bedroom, Person 2: Office/Living)
2. Renamed checklist files to place date after "Deep_Clean_" prefix
3. Created master to-do list for task tracking
4. Built complete handoff documentation system (this infrastructure)

### Current State
- **4 HTML checklists** exist (2 per-person + 1 full-house + 1 DEV)
- **Naming convention** updated in files but guide not yet updated
- **Handoff system** fully operational with progress reports, state files, and handoff docs

## Critical Warnings

### Fragile Areas
| Area | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| File renames | External links may break | Check for any hardcoded URLs |
| `.credentials/` | Contains sensitive data | Never commit, already in .gitignore |
| localStorage keys | Checklists use `team-member-1-*` and `team-member-2-*` prefixes | Changing IDs breaks saved progress |

### Do Not
- Commit `.credentials/` folder contents
- Change checkbox IDs in HTML without updating localStorage keys
- Push directly to main branch

## Open Questions for Next Session

1. **DEV file purpose**: What's different between `Deep_Clean_2025-11-26_Full_House_Single_Cleaner_Prioritized.html` and the `_DEV.html` version?

2. **Naming guide update**: Should `Cleaning_Checklists_File_Naming_Convention_and_Standards_Guide_2025-11-26.md` be updated to reflect new date placement?

3. **Google Sheets integration**: What functionality exists? (See git commit 2d0a1c1)

4. **index.html role**: Is this actively used as a landing page?
